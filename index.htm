      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm an engineer with Amazon and have been in IT for 20 years.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Grew up in Colombia and all over the USA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Covid has dramatically changed my hobbies.  Boxing and martial arts are out and video games and coding are in.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I largely have it already but I'd like to move up to principal engineer in development.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Fremont is great, I'm sad I didn't get to enjoy my first summer living here.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I do systems and network engineering so I already develop things but not full stack.  My algorith knowledge is abysmal and I've never worked on a front end, I tend to hack apart existing systems and extend them for my use cases.  I would like to be able to actually develop a full stack and practice it until I get reasonably good.</p>
